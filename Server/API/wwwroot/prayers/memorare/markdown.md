## How to Pray?

Recite the prayer with faith and devotion, turning to Mary in times of need:

> **Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary,
> that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection,
> implored thy help, or sought thy intercession was left unaided.
> Inspired by this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother;
> to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful.
> O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions,
> but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.**

Use it when seeking guidance, help, or comfort, especially in difficult circumstances.
