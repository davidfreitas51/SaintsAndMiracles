## How to Pray?

Recite the prayer thoughtfully, reflecting on each phrase:

> **Our Father, who art in heaven,
> hallowed be Thy name;
> Thy kingdom come;
> Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
> Give us this day our daily bread;
> and forgive us our trespasses,
> as we forgive those who trespass against us;
> and lead us not into temptation,
> but deliver us from evil. Amen.**

Use it in daily prayer, during Mass, or anytime you seek guidance, strength, and God’s protection.
