## How to Pray?

Recite the prayer sincerely, acknowledging your sins and seeking God’s forgiveness:

> **O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee,
> and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell,
> but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, who art all-good and deserving of all my love.
> I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.**

Say it during Confession, before or after Mass, or anytime you seek reconciliation with God.
