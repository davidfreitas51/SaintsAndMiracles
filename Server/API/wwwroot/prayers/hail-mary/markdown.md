The **Hail Mary** is a traditional Catholic prayer honoring the Blessed Virgin Mary and asking for her intercession. It is rooted in the greetings of the Angel Gabriel at the **Annunciation** and Elizabeth at the **Visitation**, and is a key prayer in the **Rosary**.

## How to Pray?

Recite the prayer thoughtfully, acknowledging Mary’s holiness and asking for her guidance:

> **Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee;
> Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
> Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.**

Repeat it as part of personal devotion or within the Rosary, meditating on the life of Christ and the example of Mary.
